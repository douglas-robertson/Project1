Project Title:
Impact of GDP on Carbon Emissions by Country

Team Members: 
Virginia Mwape, Douglas Robertson, Cheng Tan

Project Description/Outline:

Research Questions to Answer:
	1. Does a countries GDP have an impact on it's carbon emission?
	2. Is there a tipping point where carbon emissions either increase or decrease depending on GDP?
	3. What impact does global carbon emissions have on global average temperature?

Datasets to be Used:
World Bank Data Emissions History Dataset
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT
Global Surface Temperature by City Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/version/2

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Virginia - Create dataframes for analyse GDP vs carbon emissions data.
Douglas - Create dataframes for carbone emissions over time and global temperatures per city.
Cheng - Generate diagrams and maps to present the information. Pull together presentation for class.
