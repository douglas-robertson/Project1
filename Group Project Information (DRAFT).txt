Project Title:
Relationship of GDP on Carbon Emissions (CO2 per kg) by Region

Team Members: 
Virginia Mwape, Douglas Robertson, Cheng Tan

Project Description/Outline:

Research Questions to Answer:
	1. Does a countries GDP have an impact on it's carbon emission? and if yes, Is there a tipping point where carbon emissions 
	either increase or decrease depending on GDP?
	2. Analyse dataset as per regions and see if there is any trends between carbon emissions and GDP.


Datasets to be Used:
World Bank Data Emissions History Dataset
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.KT?end=2020&start=1960 (CO2 - Data)
https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD (GDP - Data)


Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
	1. Each group member cleans a data set each.
	2. Each group member explores a specific region to see if there are any relationship between carbon emission and GDP.


Core Questions - 
Does GDP have a statistical impact on carbon emission levels? 
Look at a per capita component.
